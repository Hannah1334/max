<h1>Detailed Information</h1>
<b>Appearance</b><br>
While Quinnes are humanoid in appearance, they are not human whatsoever. They have the common build and reproduce the same way, but their flesh is closer to lizard skin than human skin, and they are incapable of being more than two-hundred pounds. M.A.X. is just over six feet in height and her build can be compared to a very athletic human female. While she has a feminine hourglass shape, her bust and rear are on the average-to-smaller side of the spectrum. Her skin is a pale blue color and has various natural markings all over her body that are a slightly darker shade. Gills can be found on both sides of her neck and along the sides of her abdomen--from stomach to just under her chest. Big filmy blue eyes stare out from underneath a curtain of dark blue wavy hair. Her face is structured thin with sharp cheekbones and jawline.<br>
A decent number of fins can be found on various helpful locations around her body, like behind her ears and between her fingers and toes.
<br><br>
<b>Personality</b><br>
Most would argue that, given her most commonly demonstrated behavior, she is unpredictable. Her childish and almost autistic behavior (haha!) is only a distraction that works in her favor, allowing her to seem erratic but ultimately harmless. On the contrary, she is a very sly and conniving individual, an observer who only takes action after planning. With the patience of a saint, she can observe meaningless things for hours on end just to learn everything she can about them and use them to her advantage later on. It's incredibly hard to tell, but her mind never allows her to make a move without a proper calculation.
</div>

<div id="tab2">
<h1>M.A.X.'s Story</h1>
Misaliannia-Anatix-Xercolophia was hatched from an egg produced between two proud and powerful warriors of her native Tribe. They were an unstoppable people, taking territory by sea and land, living through days of glory. The older she grew, however, the more apparent it became that something wasn't quite right with her. Granted, she was incredibly smart, acing written tests and various trials set by infamous taciticians within their extended community, but there was something off about her personality, processing skills, and general communication abilities. 
<br><br>
As she grew up, it became clear that her greatest talents would not be put to good use on the battlefield but rather in the research department, which was necessary but not as admirable. Working hard to please the demands of her overbearing family, M.A.X. began an obsession with studying the various ways creatures process chemicals and how they could use different nonlethal substances as deadly weapons on their unsuspecting foes. While effective, the Quinne were far too proud of their valiant ways to accept anything sneaky or underhanded and demanded she stop. M.A.X. merely continued her research in secret, and when she was aprehended for her crimes she defected. Her parents and family members snubbed her, completely cutting their ties and leaving her completely alone.
<br><br>
She faced their bias court system and was stuck into a local prison, but managed to make an escape. M.A.X. had been raised to be so reliant on her bretheren that she couldn't survive the terrain of her home planet all on her own, and was continuously caught and put back behind bars. This continued so many times that it was almost forgotten why she was originally imprisoned and she was instead dubbed an escape artist. Her people feared the influence of her feats on criminal minds and instead submitted her into the hands of a galaxy-wide government. Now she is headed for an intergalactic prison, maximum security, where the entire solar system itself is the prison.
<br>
Her greatest challenge yet.
</div>

<div id="tab3">
<h1>The Racials of a Quinne</h1>
<b>Tooth and Nail</b><br>
Mouths full of sharp strong teeth, and equally tough fingernails. The ends of their long spindly fingers and toes have sharp pointed nails, intended for a strong grip in soft substances and prying apart things like shellfish.
<br><br>
<b>Retractable Tail</b><br>
Quinnes have a retractable limb that, when they are not using it or are on dry land, sits at the base of their spine above their rears and takes the appearance of just a typical pair of fins (considering they are covered from head-to-toe in fin-like appendages it doesn't seem very out of place) that can extend into a long dolphin-like tail. This is a very muscular limb that is the main way they propel themselves through water, aside from their fingers and toes being webbed. It allows them to do various complicated maneuvers and even reach high speeds beneathe the water's surface.
<br><br>
<b>Cold Blood</b><br>
Like most amphibious reptilian creatures, Quinnes and their Zaydia counterparts are cold blooded.
<br><br>
<b>Blue Skin</b><br>
All Quinnes have pale blue skin with various darker blue markings and designs coating their flesh as just a base aesthetic. This skin, however, is very water resistant, allowing them to stay underwater their entire lives, much like a fish, if they so desired. In addition, there is a thin translucent layer of skin that acts as an extra eyelid, covering the eyeball to protect it from extended exposure to water.
<br><br>
<b>Gills</b><br>
Along the sides of their necks and their abdomens are gills, otherwise known as advanced oxygen filters, that are incredibly adaptable. When exposed to small doses of harmful substances (either in liquid or in gas form) for long periods of time, these gills can learn how to adapt to filter out those harmful substances and intake oxygen instead. (Can passively breathe dry oxygen or underwater)
<br><br>
<b>Eggs</b><br>
While the reproductive process is very similar to that of the typical animal or humanoid, female Quinne lay eggs. They generally lay one per cycle (one egg a month) regardless of whether or not it has been fertilized. Nonfertile eggs are filled with deadly toxins, consumption is not advised. 
<br><br>
<b>Adaptability</b><br>
On their home planet, Quinnes are the most evolutionary superior creatures. Their minds are constantly processing information around them for the sake of benefitting their own bodies. If they live for long times away from their natural environments, they'll adapt traits to better survive in those environments during their own lifespans.
<br><br>
<b>Lifespans</b><br>
The average life expectancy of a healthy Quinne (dying of old age) is about two hundred human years. They are officially adults when they have survived fifty of those.
<br><br>
<h1>The Zaydia</h1>
<img align="left" style="width:40%;" src="https://i.imgur.com/j35E6jD.gif"/>
Evolved from the same core beings as the Quinnes, the Zaydias are a "lesser" creature that have adapted to live only underwater (as it is much safer, the dangerous creatures of this aquatic world mostly occupy land). While still faintly humanoid in appearance, their legs remain permanent fish tails. While it is possible for them to breathe dry atmospheres for short periods of time, they cannot survive out of water like their counterparts can. Despite all of this, they are still clever creatures that are just as sentient and high functioning as their amphibious counterparts, and are at the top of the underwater food chain. Zaydias rule the seas.
<br><br>
<h1>The Quinne</h1>
<img align="right" style="width:30%;" src="https://i.imgur.com/bwIpMBH.png"/>
Incredibly smart and tactical creatures by nature, the Quinnes are the perfect evolutionary specimens, adapted--and still adapting--to the point that they have become perfect for the environment of their home planet. Amphibious and humanoid, they can live equally under water or on land, and live in large families known as "Tribes." Quinnes are the superior race of their homeworld, constantly developing new ways to hunt, horde landmasses, and even move entire landmasses freely as though they were massive ships.
</div>

<div id="tab4">
<h1>Laws, Customs & Beliefs</h1>
<b>Social Circles</b><br>
The Quinnes view the Zadiyas to be cowardly weaklings, while the Zadiyas view them as barbaric and cruel. Quinnes are primarily war-based creatures who take pleasure in the hunt, the kill, and most of all victory.
<br><br>
<b>Moral Alignment</b><br>
They believe very strongly in embracing change and advancing in society as long as it is done humanely. Even in war a foe's suffering is not prolonged and it is considered a high honor to face off bravely against the Quinne's. They have very strong "humane" morals about how to properly treat friend and foe, any wrongs committed to one another anyone can think of will be treated with equal prejudice and punishment.
<br><br>
<b>Marriage & Mating</b><br>
The Tribe often decides who will marry who based on skills. Every union is arranged with the Tribe in mind, allowing the birth of many well-bred young in order to create the perfect soldiers. Romance and attachments are encouraged but only within these arranged families, and if one's family member becomes a criminal, unless they are immediately socially ejected the whole family suffers. Loyalty to traitors in any shape or form is not tolerated.
<br><br>
<b>Hierarchy</b><br>
A Tribe's leader is decided in a tournament, the last person standing wins. In the case of leaders who already have mates and families--currently living--then their entire families are expected to be the last ones standing in each trial. Only the strongest with the most clever minds and highest pedegree stand a chance.

<h1>M.A.X.'s Special Traits</h1>
<b>Chemist</b><br>
Will be able to get readings on alien composition and other chemistry based matters. Can use chemistry to solve certain problems, like creating explosives etc. 
<br><br>
<b>Biochemist</b><br>
Has the ability to determine the lethal effects of alien chemistry on most biology. Can help create defenses against certain alien attacks and other hazards that the party might face in the field. 
<br><br>
<b>Inventive</b><br>
Generally a mad fucking scientist. Can create an array of useful tools and other weapons (With collaboration from Depurate) 
<br>
As well as mesh with all other party specializations to create upgrades.
<br><br>
<b>Learning Curve</b><br>
Has the ability to learn things that pertain to specific patterns very quickly (so music, languages, fighting styles, etc)
<br>
While she can't usually reciprocate the things she's learned, she can at least understand them. This has to do with her mental evolutionary traits.
<br><br>
<b>Photographic Memory</b><br>
Being able to save things she sees in a picture-esque memory that she can call up in her mind's eye, allowing her to remember every little detail about the scene as though staring at a snapshot taken from a camera. This is incredibly useful for remembering chemical formulas.
